### Predictive modeling and analytics for diabetes 

### This repository contains data preprocessing and four different approaches to predict diabetes using different machine learning algorithms. They are five separate notebooks and as follows:

1. Data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (preprocessing.ipynb): This notebook contains data preprocessing and EDA for the diabetes dataset. It also contains data visualization and correlation analysis.
2 . Logistic Regression ([logistic_regression.ipynb](./logistic_regression.ipynb)): This notebook contains the logistic regression model for diabetes prediction.
3. Random Forest ([random_forest.ipynb](./random_forest.ipynb)): This notebook contains the random forest model for diabetes prediction.
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) ([svm.ipynb](./svm.ipynb)): This notebook contains the support vector machine model for diabetes prediction.
5. Neural Network ([neural_network.ipynb](./neural_network.ipynb)): This notebook contains the neural network model for diabetes prediction.

#### Utility functions:

1. [common.py](./common.py) : This file contains the common functions used in all the notebooks. It contains the functions for data preprocessing, data visualization, model evaluation, and model prediction.
